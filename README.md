# Rental Bike Prediction using Machine Learning Models

The project aims to develop a model capable of accurately predicting the number of rental bikes out at each hour, based on other relevant features such as hour of the day, date, humidity, and other factors. In addition to building the model, the aim is also to select the best performing model through hyperparameter tuning. By identifying the optimal hyperparameters, the chosen model is expected to outperform other models and provide more precise predictions.

## Tech Stack

**Programming Languages:** Python

**Methods Used:** Machine Learning, Data pre-processing, Exploratory Data Analysis, Hyperparameter Tuning

## Models

The Machine Learning Models used are:

- Baseline Model Dummy Regressor
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Trees
